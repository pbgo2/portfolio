1) To print string eg. "hello" as Ascii-Art
	go run . "hello" standard --align=right (other formats allow: left/center/justify)

2) Work the best if run in pure terminal window (not vsc) if drag right bottom corner could adjust terminal window size to your preference.

3) After run it the program waiting to resize and adopt terminal window size, if you want close it and submit different string to be 
	print as ascii-art  ,program need close by Ctrl-C. Clear terminal after (command clear) also advised.

4) If you squize too much and terminal window became too small to be able print ascii-art without glich it will print message 
	"Not enough space for ascii-art". 

5) ./main "hello" standard --align=right  	--in ubuntu to run binary file (eg. string to dislay "hello")
